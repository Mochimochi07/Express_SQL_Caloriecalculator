# Express_SQL_Caloriecalculator

This is my calorie calculator app.

you can use this for testing and learning some physics.

well if you modify this enough you can have a little experience in combining servers and Competitive programming.

I just worked out a little bit for my strength.

I realized the fun in the pain that i gained.

This might be the last server that i can make before i go back to Golang in March.

It was fun learning javascript though because of that i learned how to make things efficiently.

this purposee is just my curiosity about combining sample competitive programming and servers while learning.
